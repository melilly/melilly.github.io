## About Me

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student, double majoring in [physics](https://catalog.usu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=9639) and [computer science](https://catalog.usu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=9373) at Utah State University.

I've contributed to a number of research projects, from computer science middle school curriculum to gamma-ray pulsars, to explore and expand my research capabilities. 

I plan to focus my expertise into computational physics research - simulations, visualizations, analysis of large datasets. I aim to begin a PhD in physics in fall 2022. 

My extra energies are put toward efforts of STEM outreach via fun and engaging puzzles for the analytical mind. I want to provide the opportunities to explore scientific problems that I would have enjoyed as a young child.

  **Examining Reaction Networks used in Convection Models in Helium Shells of Sub-Chandrasehkar White Dwarfs**
  
  This project simulates the explosion of a dense white dwarf star. In the model, a helium layer surrounds the star. Initial ignition of the helium layer can cause the helium, then the star itself, to burn and explode as a type of supernova. Computer simulations of this phenomemon, by necessity, ignore elements or chemical reactions, in order to simplify the problem enough to be tractable. In this work, I explore the sensitivity of the explosion to such modifications by comparing complicated simulations with their simpler counterparts.
