## About Me

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student, double majoring in [physics](https://catalog.usu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=9639) and [computer science](https://catalog.usu.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=12&poid=9373) at Utah State University.

I've contributed to a number of research projects, from computer science middle school curriculum to gamma-ray pulsars, to explore and expand my research capabilities. 

I plan to focus my expertise into computational physics research - simulations, visualizations, analysis of large datasets. I aim to begin a PhD in physics in fall 2022. 

My extra energies are put toward efforts of STEM outreach via fun and engaging puzzles for the analytical mind. I want to provide the opportunities to explore scientific problems that I would have enjoyed as a young child.

  **The Making of Harry Potter's Wand**

  Harry P., Hermione G., *et al*
  
  Harry's wand was broken in 1997, but was repaired by him after the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts. Usually the repair of a wand is impossible, but with the use of the Elder Wand it was achievable.

  **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows**
  
  In the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, which is set 19 years after Voldemort's death, Harry and Ginny are a couple and have three children: James Sirius Potter, who has already been at Hogwarts for at least one year, Albus Severus Potter, who is starting his first year there, and Lily Luna Potter, who is two years away from her first year at the school.
