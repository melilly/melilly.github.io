# Gamma-ray Pulsars

The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has detected hundreds of Galactic gamma-ray sources, most of them pulsars. But tens of thousands more sources remain undetected because they are too far, too dim, or too close together to be distinguished. These sources contribute to the diffuse Galactic emission, serving as a source of confusion for other studies. Here, we study the properties of pulsars with the goal of estimating the number of sources below the Fermi LAT flux sensitivity threshold. This would allow an estimation of the contribution to the diffuse emission.

Here I show results after adjusting a model of the detected and undetected pulsars for best fit parameters, by comparing it with the Fermi 4FGL-DR2 catalog. I identified preliminary best fit luminosity function slope, minimum luminosity, and source density for a given source distribution. I then used the model with the best fit parameters to determine the number of pulsars as a function of flux, including those below the sensitivity threshold.
