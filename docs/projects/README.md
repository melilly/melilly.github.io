  **Supernova Ia: Double Detonation in Sub-Chandrasehkar White Dwarfs**
  
  This project simulates the explosion of a dense white dwarf star. In the model, a helium layer surrounds the star. Initial ignition of the helium layer can cause the helium, then the star itself, to burn and explode as a type of supernova. Computer simulations of this phenomemon, by necessity, ignore elements or chemical reactions, in order to simplify the problem enough to be tractable. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of the explosion to such modifications by comparing complicated simulations with their simpler counterparts.

  It is thought that ignition of a helium layer surrounding a dense white dwarf star can trigger the helium, and then the star itself, to burn and explode as a type of supernova. In order to simplify the problem enough for computers to model, other works have ignored some chemical reactions in their simulations. Here we compare simulations including additional chemical reactions to their simpler counterparts to explore the accuracy of the simulations.

  **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows**
  
  In the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, which is set 19 years after Voldemort's death, Harry and Ginny are a couple and have three children: James Sirius Potter, who has already been at Hogwarts for at least one year, Albus Severus Potter, who is starting his first year there, and Lily Luna Potter, who is two years away from her first year at the school.
