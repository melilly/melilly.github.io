  **Examining Reaction Networks used in Convection Models in Helium Shells of Sub-Chandrasehkar White Dwarfs**
  
  This project simulates the explosion of a dense white dwarf star. In the model, a helium layer surrounds the star. Initial ignition of the helium layer can cause the helium, then the star itself, to burn and explode as a type of supernova. Computer simulations of this phenomemon, by necessity, ignore elements or chemical reactions, in order to simplify the problem enough to be tractable. In this work, I explore the sensitivity of the explosion to such modifications by comparing complicated simulations with their simpler counterparts.

  **Properties of Gamma-ray Pulsars from the Large Area Telescope**

  Modern telescopes, like the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), have a sensitivity threshold below which individual point sources cannot be distinguished from background [diffuse emission](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/eteu/diffuse/). Instead, data about these point sources can be inferred from a model of the detectable point sources. In this project, I adjust a model for [gamma-ray pulsars](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/pulsars2.html.old). By comparing the model to LAT's [recent catalog](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/10yr_catalog/), I identified details about pulsars' luminosity and density in space that best fit the data, then extrapolated to estimate the number of undetected pulsars below the sensitivity threshold.
